Once you have pip installed, you can run these commands in terminal (Mac) or the command prompt (Windows) to download the required libraries

# How to Run 

In order to run and edit the code, first download the zip file containing all the files and then unzip the folder. Then, move the folder to your desktop and rename it to **JobScraper**

If you want to execute the python notebook file (.ipynb), you will have to download jupyter notebook by running `pip install notebook` in terminal or command prompt then opening up juypter notebook by running `jupyter notebook`. You can then upload the code from there

If you want to run the python file (.py), run `cd desktop` to navigate to your desktop directory. Then, run `cd JobScraper` to navigate to that folder and finally run `jobscraper.py` to execute the code.
